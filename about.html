        Cultlang is a lisp dialect which provides an Intermediate Representation for compiler frontends. 
        Although we may write different langauges engineers and computer scientists work every day with
        the same <i>semantics</i>. Historically when a new idea in computing was discovered, from 
        structured programming to incremental type systems it was natural to invent along with it a new langauge
        to explore those ideas. Sadly this silos us, leaving programmers to evangelize new followers into their
        respective isolated communities.  
      </p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        Cult looks to change the status quo and bring a truly shared programming environment to the masses. By 
        decoupling the <i>Syntax</i> of languages from their <i>Semantics</i>. In analogy if Cult were a compiler
        it would be LLVM. If it were a Star Trek technology it would be the Universal Translator. If it were a nation it
        would be the United Nations.

        To be clear: we are talking about a <b>machine native</b>, <b>incrementally typed</b>, <b>library rich</b> programming
        environment with zero cost abstraction across syntacies that behave like your current programming environment. Additionally
        Cultlang's type system and runtime is <b>embedable</b> in your walled garden, so even if your software is reliant on your
        native extensions you <i>still get access to Cult's features.</i>
